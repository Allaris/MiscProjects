Edit the /etc/sysctl.conf file to enable packet forwarding

$ sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf

Remove the # from the beginning of the line containing net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
This will enable packet forwarding on next reboot. But if you want to try it right now
without reboot then do this.
$ sudo sh -c &quot;echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward&quot;

 We also need to share RPi’s internet connection with the devices connected over Wi-Fi.
We will configure a NAT between eth0 and wlan0. Before applying new rules, you have
to first delete any existing rules using the commands sudo iptables -F and sudo
iptables -t nat -F

$ sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o wlan0 -j MASQUERADE
$ sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i wlan0 -o eth0 -m state -- state
RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
$ sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -o wlan0 -j ACCEPT

However, we need these rules to be applied every time we reboot the Pi, so run sudo
sh -c &quot;iptables-save &gt; /etc/iptables.ipv4.nat&quot; to save the rules to the
file /etc/iptables.ipv4.nat. Now we need to run this after each reboot, so open
the /etc/rc.local file with sudo nano /etc/rc.local and just above the line exit
0, add the following line:

$ iptables-restore &lt; /etc/iptables.ipv4.nat

 And that’s all! Now just Reboot your RPi and you will be able to access Internet

$ sudo reboot
